# Advanced Catalyst Example

This is an example of a Catalyst app using a three-column layout, with a primary toolbar.

It includes topics such as:
- Drag & drop reordering of the sidebar items
- Scaling UI metrics between Mac Idiom and iPad Idiom
- Using Codable to load a data store from disk and present it
- Using an AppKit bundle to access APIs not available to Catalyst, like NSSearchToolbarItem
- Mixing a SwiftUI detail view into a UIKit app structure
- Using the UIKit Focus Engine to provide keyboard navigation
- Providing a Credits file for your About window
